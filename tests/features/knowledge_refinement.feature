Feature: Knowledge Refinement and Learning
    As a research system
    I want to continuously refine my understanding
    So that I can provide increasingly accurate results

    Background:
        Given the research engine is initialized
        And the confidence crew is ready
        And the knowledge graph is empty

    Scenario: Learning from Research Results
        When I research "async error handling patterns"
        Then I should find at least 5 code examples
        And store them in the knowledge graph
        And calculate initial confidence scores
        
        When I analyze the research results
        Then I should identify common patterns
        And update relationship confidences
        And the average confidence should increase
        
        When I research "error handling" again
        Then I should find more relevant results
        And the false positive rate should be lower
        And the knowledge graph should show stronger relationships

    Scenario: Adapting to Feedback
        Given I have researched "dependency injection"
        When I receive feedback that some results were irrelevant
        Then I should adjust confidence parameters
        And increase the similarity threshold
        And record the feedback in the knowledge graph
        
        When I research "dependency injection" again
        Then I should get fewer but more relevant results
        And the confidence scores should reflect the feedback
        And similar searches should benefit from the adjustment

    Scenario: Building Domain Understanding
        When I research multiple related topics:
            | Topic                  | Relevance |
            | state management      | high      |
            | component lifecycle   | high      |
            | data flow            | high      |
            | event handling       | medium    |
        Then I should identify domain relationships
        And build a topic hierarchy
        And calculate topic relevance scores
        
        When I research a new related topic
        Then I should use the domain understanding
        And prioritize more relevant patterns
        And maintain relationship confidence scores

    Scenario: Chained Research Refinement
        Given I start with a high-level topic "web security"
        When I perform chained research:
            | Chain                          | Depth |
            | authentication patterns        | 1     |
            | token validation              | 2     |
            | secure session management     | 3     |
        Then each chain should build on previous knowledge
        And confidence scores should improve
        And the knowledge graph should show depth relationships
        
        When I explore a related security topic
        Then I should leverage the accumulated knowledge
        And identify cross-cutting patterns
        And maintain high confidence scores

    Scenario: Knowledge Graph Evolution
        Given I have an existing knowledge base
        When I research new implementation patterns
        Then I should merge similar concepts
        And strengthen existing relationships
        And identify new relationships
        And update confidence scores accordingly
        
        When I validate the knowledge graph
        Then I should find consistent relationships
        And identify stable patterns
        And have well-calibrated confidence scores

    Scenario: Confidence Parameter Optimization
        Given I have research history with metrics
        When I analyze parameter effectiveness
        Then I should identify optimal ranges
        And adjust parameters gradually
        And monitor success rates
        
        When I apply the optimized parameters
        Then I should see improved research results
        And maintain parameter stability
        And log parameter evolution

    Scenario: Cross-Domain Learning
        Given I have knowledge in multiple domains
        When I identify similar patterns across domains
        Then I should create cross-domain relationships
        And calculate similarity scores
        And maintain domain-specific confidence levels
        
        When I research in a new domain
        Then I should leverage cross-domain patterns
        And adapt confidence parameters appropriately
        And preserve domain boundaries

    Scenario: Continuous Learning Loop
        Given the system has been running for some time
        When I analyze the learning progress
        Then I should see:
            | Metric                    | Trend    |
            | Average confidence        | increase |
            | False positive rate       | decrease |
            | Knowledge graph density   | increase |
            | Cross-domain connections  | increase |
        And the system should maintain learning efficiency
        And adapt to new patterns effectively
