Feature: Intelligent Code Research
    As a developer using TenX Reactive Research
    I want to research and understand code implementations
    So that I can learn from and adapt existing solutions

    Background:
        Given the research engine is initialized
        And the browser is ready
        And the knowledge base is connected

    Scenario: Research Implementation Patterns
        When I search for "async data fetching"
        Then I should receive code examples
        And the examples should be sorted by relevance
        And each example should have a source URL
        And each example should have a code snippet
        And the results should be cached in the knowledge base

    Scenario: Multi-Source Research
        When I search across multiple sources
        Then I should receive results from GitHub
        And I should receive results from Stack Overflow
        And the results should be deduplicated
        And the results should be ranked by source quality

    Scenario: Context-Aware Code Analysis
        Given I have a code snippet
        """
        async function fetchData() {
            const response = await fetch('/api/data');
            return response.json();
        }
        """
        When I analyze the code
        Then I should receive complexity metrics
        And I should receive dependency information
        And I should receive behavioral insights
        And the analysis should be stored for future reference

    Scenario: Knowledge Base Learning
        Given I have researched "error handling patterns"
        When I search for "error handling" again
        Then I should receive cached results first
        And the results should include previously found patterns
        And the results should be enriched with usage statistics

    Scenario: Language-Specific Research
        When I search for "dependency injection" with language "python"
        Then all results should be Python code
        And the examples should follow Python best practices
        And the analysis should use Python-specific metrics

    Scenario: Code Pattern Recognition
        Given I have analyzed multiple code samples
        When I request similar patterns
        Then I should receive implementations with similar structure
        And each pattern should have a similarity score
        And the patterns should be grouped by behavior

    Scenario: Real-Time Browser Research
        When I initiate a live code search
        Then the browser should navigate to relevant pages
        And extract code examples in real-time
        And validate code syntax
        And store successful findings

    Scenario: Intelligent Result Filtering
        Given I have search results
        When I filter by complexity score
        Then I should receive simpler implementations first
        And each result should include complexity metrics
        And the results should maintain relevance ranking

    Scenario: Code Understanding
        Given I have a complex code implementation
        When I request code explanation
        Then I should receive structural analysis
        And behavioral insights
        And potential improvements
        And similar patterns from the knowledge base
